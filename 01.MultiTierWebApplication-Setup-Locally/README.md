# V Profile Project - Local Multi-Tier Web Application Setup

## 01. Introduction

Welcome to the **V Profile Project** – a foundational DevOps project aimed at setting up a **multi-tier web application stack** in a local environment. This project serves as the baseline for many upcoming hands-on DevOps initiatives, including containerization, Kubernetes deployments, CI/CD implementations, and infrastructure automation.

The project simulates a **real-world web application** stack typically found in production environments, and allows developers and DevOps engineers to conduct R&D locally without relying on shared or cloud environments. It promotes best practices in automation and repeatability using tools like **Vagrant**, **VirtualBox**, and **Bash scripting**.

## 02. VM Setup

This guide outlines the steps to set up virtual machines using **Vagrant** for the **V Profile Project**. This setup allows you to simulate a complete multi-tier application stack on your local machine for testing, learning, and DevOps experimentation.

---

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Git
- A terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows)

---

### 📦 Clone the Repository

1. Open [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project) in your browser.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL.
3. Open VS Code (or any other IDE/Terminal of your choice).
4. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project.git
   ```

5. Navigate to the cloned folder.

---

### 🌿 Switch to the Correct Git Branch

The source code has multiple branches. Make sure to switch to the `local` branch:

- In VS Code, click on the bottom-left branch name (e.g., `main`).

- Select `origin/local`.

You should now see the `local` branch checked out.

---

### 📁 Navigate to the Correct Folder

Choose the folder based on your OS architecture:

- Windows, Mac (Intel), Linux:

```bash
cd vprofile-project/vagrant/Manual_provisioning_WinMacIntel
```

- Mac (M1/M2/M3):

```bash
cd vprofile-project/vagrant/Manual_provisioning_MacOSM1
```

---

### 🔌 Install Required Vagrant Plugin

Run this command to install the plugin:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
```

This plugin auto-manages the host-to-IP mapping in the /etc/hosts file on your system.

---

### 🧹 (Optional) Clean Up Existing VMs

Check for any running VMs:

```bash
vagrant global-status
```

If any VM is active, destroy them:

```bash
cd <project-path>
vagrant destroy
```

Clean stale records:

```bash
vagrant global-status --prune
```

---

### 🚀 Start the VMs

Run the following command inside the correct folder:

```bash
vagrant up
```

- Screenshot:

  ![alt text](<images/01.vagrant up screenshot.png>)

- You can check from the Oracle VirtualBox interface:
  ![alt text](<images/02.Oracle VirtualBox.png>)

This will bring up five virtual machines:

- db01 – MySQL
- mc01 – Memcached
- rmq01 – RabbitMQ
- app01 – Tomcat (Java App)
- web01 – Nginx (Load Balancer)

💡 Note: First-time startup may take several minutes.

---

### 🧾 Validate Setup

After vagrant up, verify the following:

1. SSH into a VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh web01
```

2. Switch to Root User:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

3. Check the host file:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

You should see hostname-to-IP mappings like:

```bash
192.168.56.10   db01
192.168.56.11   mc01
192.168.56.12   rmq01
192.168.56.13   app01
192.168.56.14   web01
```

4. Ping services:

```bash
ping db01 -c 4
ping mc01 -c 4
```

- Screenshot:

  ![alt text](<images/03.vagrant ssh web01.png>)

---

### 🔄 Rebooting / Reloading VMs

If any VM fails to start or throws a timeout:

```bash
vagrant reload <vm-name>      # Reload specific VM
vagrant reload                # Reload all VMs
```

---

### 📐 VM Architecture

Each service is deployed on a separate VM:

```bash
[ Nginx (web01) ]
        ↓
[ Tomcat (app01) ]
        ↓
[ RabbitMQ (rmq01) ]
        ↓
[ Memcached (mc01) ]
        ↓
[ MySQL (db01) ]
```

---

### ⚠️ Order of Provisioning

It is recommended to configure services in the following order:

MySQL (db01)

Memcached (mc01)

RabbitMQ (rmq01)

Tomcat (app01)

Nginx (web01)

And shut them down in reverse order.

---

### 🧪 Optional Exercise

Log in to each VM using:

```bash
vagrant ssh <vm-name>
```

And try pinging the other services to verify host resolution:

```bash
ping db01 -c 4
ping mc01 -c 4
```

---

---

---

## 03. MySQL Setup

This section walks you through the setup and configuration of **MySQL (MariaDB)** for the VProfile project. This is a critical step, as all services in the application depend on a properly configured and initialized database.

---

### 📦 Prerequisites

Before starting:

- Ensure all VMs are up and running.
- If you took a long break, run `vagrant reload` in the appropriate folder to restart the VMs:

  ```bash
  vagrant reload
  ```

Make sure you are inside the correct directory:
`vprofile-project/vagrant/Manual_provisioning_WinMacIntel`

---

### 🚪 Step 1: SSH into the DB VM

Log into the database VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh db01
```

Switch to the root user:

```bash
sudo -i
```

---

### 🔄 Step 2: System Update

Update the system to get the latest patches:

```bash
dnf update -y
```

---

### 📥 Step 3: Install Required Packages

Install EPEL repository, Git, and MariaDB Server:

```bash
dnf install epel-release -y
dnf install git mariadb-server -y
```

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Start and Enable MariaDB

Start and enable the database service:

```bash
systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb
systemctl status mariadb
```

---

### 🔐 Step 5: Secure the Database

Run the security script to configure root access and remove vulnerabilities:

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

Answer the questions as follows:

- Current root password? → Press Enter (no password yet)

- Switch to unix_socket authentication? → Enter (default Yes)

- Change root password? → Yes
  Use: admin123

- Remove anonymous users? → Yes

- Disallow root login remotely? → Yes

- Remove test database? → Yes

- Reload privilege tables now? → Yes

---

### 💾 Step 6: Login to MySQL

Login with the root user:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter password: `admin123`

---

### 🏗️ Step 7: Create Database and User

Inside the MySQL prompt:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE accounts;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EXIT;
```

- Screenshot:

---

### 🧬 Step 8: Load DB Schema (SQL Dump)

Clone the source code:

```bash
cd /tmp

git clone -b local https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project.git

cd vprofile-project
```

Navigate to SQL file location:

```bash
cd src/main/resources
```

Run SQL dump into the database:

```bash
mysql -u root -p accounts < db_backup.sql
```

Password: `admin123`

---

### 🔍 Step 9: Verify Database

Login to MySQL again:

```bash
mysql -u root -p accounts
```

List the tables:

```bash
SHOW TABLES;
```

You should see a list of tables populated from the `db_backup.sql`.

To check available databases:

```bash
SHOW DATABASES;
```

## 04. Memcached Setup

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Memcached service for the VProfile project. Memcached is used here as a caching layer to improve performance.

### 🖥️ Target Environment

- VM Name: `mc01`
- OS: CentOS 8 (or similar)
- Tool: Vagrant
- User: `vagrant` (switch to root during setup)

---

### 🔧 Setup Steps

1. Connect to Memcached VM

```bash
vagrant ssh mc01
sudo -i  # Switch to root
```

2. Update System Packages (Optional)

```bash
dnf update -y
```

⚠️ This step is optional for this lab project **(takes long time)** but recommended in real-world setups to apply latest patches.

3. Install Required Packages
   Install EPEL repository and Memcached service:

```bash
dnf install epel-release -y
dnf install memcached -y
```

4. Enable and Start Memcached

```bash
systemctl start memcached
systemctl enable memcached
```

5. Configure Memcached for Remote Access
   By default, Memcached listens only to `127.0.0.1` (localhost). To allow connections from external services (e.g., Tomcat), change it to `0.0.0.0`.

Run the following command to modify the config:

```bash
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' /etc/sysconfig/memcached
```

Verify change (optional):

```bash
cat /etc/sysconfig/memcached
```

- Screenshot:

![alt text](<images/07.Configure Memcached for Remote Access.png>)

6. Restart Memcached Service

```bash
systemctl restart memcached
```

7. Manually Start Memcached Daemon (Optional)
   Run Memcached manually with default port (11211: TCP port / 11111: UDP port):

```bash
memcached -p 11211 -U 11111 -u memcached -d
```

🔁 `-d` runs it as a background process (daemon).

---

### 🔥 Notes

- **Port 11211:** Memcached default port
- Ensure the configuration allows remote connections if your app runs on a different VM.
- Firewall settings are not mandatory for this lab. They will be discussed in detail in networking sections.
