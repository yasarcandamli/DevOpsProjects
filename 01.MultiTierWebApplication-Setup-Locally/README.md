## 02. VM Setup

This guide outlines the steps to set up virtual machines using **Vagrant** for the **V Profile Project**. This setup allows you to simulate a complete multi-tier application stack on your local machine for testing, learning, and DevOps experimentation.

---

### üß∞ Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:

- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Vagrant
- Git
- A terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows)

---

### üì¶ Clone the Repository

1. Open [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project) in your browser.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL.
3. Open VS Code (or any other IDE/Terminal of your choice).
4. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hkhcoder/vprofile-project.git
   ```

5. Navigate to the cloned folder.

---

### üåø Switch to the Correct Git Branch

The source code has multiple branches. Make sure to switch to the `local` branch:

- In VS Code, click on the bottom-left branch name (e.g., `main`).

- Select `origin/local`.

You should now see the `local` branch checked out.

---

### üìÅ Navigate to the Correct Folder

Choose the folder based on your OS architecture:

- Windows, Mac (Intel), Linux:

```bash
cd vprofile-project/vagrant/Manual_provisioning_WinMacIntel
```

- Mac (M1/M2/M3):

```bash
cd vprofile-project/vagrant/Manual_provisioning_MacOSM1
```

---

### üîå Install Required Vagrant Plugin

Run this command to install the plugin:

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
```

This plugin auto-manages the host-to-IP mapping in the /etc/hosts file on your system.

---

### üßπ (Optional) Clean Up Existing VMs

Check for any running VMs:

```bash
vagrant global-status
```

If any VM is active, destroy them:

```bash
cd <project-path>
vagrant destroy
```

Clean stale records:

```bash
vagrant global-status --prune
```

---

### üöÄ Start the VMs

Run the following command inside the correct folder:

```bash
vagrant up
```

- Screenshot:

  ![alt text](<images/01.vagrant up screenshot.png>)

- You can check from the Oracle VirtualBox interface:
  ![alt text](<images/02.Oracle VirtualBox.png>)

This will bring up five virtual machines:

- db01 ‚Äì MySQL
- mc01 ‚Äì Memcached
- rmq01 ‚Äì RabbitMQ
- app01 ‚Äì Tomcat (Java App)
- web01 ‚Äì Nginx (Load Balancer)

üí° Note: First-time startup may take several minutes.

---

### üßæ Validate Setup

After vagrant up, verify the following:

1. SSH into a VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh web01
```

2. Switch to Root User:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

3. Check the host file:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

You should see hostname-to-IP mappings like:

```bash
192.168.56.10   db01
192.168.56.11   mc01
192.168.56.12   rmq01
192.168.56.13   app01
192.168.56.14   web01
```

4. Ping services:

```bash
ping db01 -c 4
ping mc01 -c 4
```

- Screenshot:

  ![alt text](<images/03.vagrant ssh web01.png>)

---

### üîÑ Rebooting / Reloading VMs

If any VM fails to start or throws a timeout:

```bash
vagrant reload <vm-name>      # Reload specific VM
vagrant reload                # Reload all VMs
```

---

### üìê VM Architecture

Each service is deployed on a separate VM:

```bash
[ Nginx (web01) ]
        ‚Üì
[ Tomcat (app01) ]
        ‚Üì
[ RabbitMQ (rmq01) ]
        ‚Üì
[ Memcached (mc01) ]
        ‚Üì
[ MySQL (db01) ]
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Order of Provisioning

It is recommended to configure services in the following order:

MySQL (db01)

Memcached (mc01)

RabbitMQ (rmq01)

Tomcat (app01)

Nginx (web01)

And shut them down in reverse order.

---

### üß™ Optional Exercise

Log in to each VM using:

```bash
vagrant ssh <vm-name>
```

And try pinging the other services to verify host resolution:

```bash
ping db01 -c 4
ping mc01 -c 4
```

---

- Remove test database? ‚Üí Yes

- Reload privilege tables now? ‚Üí Yes

---

### üíæ Step 6: Login to MySQL

Login with the root user:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter password: `admin123`

---

### üèóÔ∏è Step 7: Create Database and User

Inside the MySQL prompt:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE accounts;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON accounts.* TO 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin123';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

EXIT;
```

## 04. Memcached Setup

This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up the Memcached service for the VProfile project. Memcached is used here as a caching layer to improve performance.

### üñ•Ô∏è Target Environment

- VM Name: `mc01`
- OS: CentOS 8 (or similar)
- Tool: Vagrant
- User: `vagrant` (switch to root during setup)

---

### üîß Setup Steps

1. Connect to Memcached VM

```bash
vagrant ssh mc01
sudo -i  # Switch to root
```

2. Update System Packages (Optional)

```bash
dnf update -y
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This step is optional for this lab project **(takes long time)** but recommended in real-world setups to apply latest patches.

3. Install Required Packages
   Install EPEL repository and Memcached service:

```bash
dnf install epel-release -y
dnf install memcached -y
```

4. Enable and Start Memcached

```bash
systemctl start memcached
systemctl enable memcached
```

5. Configure Memcached for Remote Access
   By default, Memcached listens only to `127.0.0.1` (localhost). To allow connections from external services (e.g., Tomcat), change it to `0.0.0.0`.

Run the following command to modify the config:

```bash
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' /etc/sysconfig/memcached
```

Verify change (optional):

```bash
cat /etc/sysconfig/memcached
```

- Screenshot:

![alt text](<images/07.Configure Memcached for Remote Access.png>)

6. Restart Memcached Service

```bash
systemctl restart memcached
```

7. Manually Start Memcached Daemon (Optional)
   Run Memcached manually with default port (11211: TCP port / 11111: UDP port):

```bash
memcached -p 11211 -U 11111 -u memcached -d
```

üîÅ `-d` runs it as a background process (daemon).

---

### üî• Notes

- **Port 11211:** Memcached default port
- Ensure the configuration allows remote connections if your app runs on a different VM.
- Firewall settings are not mandatory for this lab. They will be discussed in detail in networking sections.

---

## 07. Nginx Setup

This guide explains how to set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and load balancer for forwarding HTTP requests to a backend service (e.g., Tomcat). This setup is part of a Vagrant-based multi-VM architecture, where **web01** is the Nginx server.

### üîß Objective

To configure Nginx on `web01` Ubuntu machine to:

- Listen for HTTP requests on port `80`
- Forward requests to a backend server (`app01`) running on port `8080`

---

### üß± System Overview

- **Nginx Server (web01)**: Acts as a reverse proxy/load balancer.
- **Backend App Server (app01)**: Hosts the actual application on port `8080`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Connect to the Nginx Server

```bash
vagrant ssh web01
sudo -i   # Switch to root user
```

2. Update and Upgrade System Packages

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

`apt update`: Checks for available updates.

`apt upgrade`: Applies the updates.

3. Install Nginx

```bash
apt install nginx -y
```

4. Configure Nginx

üìÅ File Location

Create the config file in:

```bash
vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/vproapp
```

üìù Sample Configuration

```bash
upstream vproapp {
    server app01:8080;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://vproapp;
    }
}
```

5. Enable the Configuration

- Remove the default config:

```bash
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

- Create a symbolic link:

```bash
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/vproapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vproapp
```

6. Restart Nginx

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

Check status:

```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

If there are errors, review the config file.

### üìÇ Directory Reference

| Directory                     | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` | Contains all virtual host configuration files |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`   | Contains symlinks to enabled virtual hosts    |

---

### ‚úÖ Final Notes

Once the setup is complete:

- Access your application via the IP of `web01` on port `80`.
- Nginx will automatically forward it to the backend service on port `8080`.

---

---

---

## 08. Validate

This document explains how to **validate the complete application stack** after setting up the Nginx reverse proxy and deploying the application. The goal is to ensure that all integrated services ‚Äî Nginx, Tomcat (backend), PostgreSQL (database), Memcached (cache), and RabbitMQ (messaging) ‚Äî are working correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Goals

- Ensure **Nginx** is forwarding requests correctly.
- Verify that the **Tomcat** application is up and serving content.
- Confirm **Database** connection by logging in with stored credentials.
- Test **RabbitMQ** integration.
- Test **Memcached** for caching mechanism.

---

### üåê Step 1: Access the Application via Browser

Open your browser and visit:
`http://192.168.56.11`

- `192.168.56.11` is the IP address of the `web01` (Nginx) server.
- HTTP uses port `80` by default, so it can be omitted in the URL.
- This request is forwarded by Nginx to the Tomcat server on port `8080`.

If the application loads, it confirms:

- Nginx is configured correctly.
- Tomcat is running.
- Nginx is successfully forwarding traffic.

- Screenshot:

![alt text](<images/08.Access the Application.png>)

### üîê Step 2: Log In to the Application

Use the following credentials:

- **Username**: `admin_vp`
- **Password**: `admin_vp`

These credentials are stored in the PostgreSQL database, loaded via DB schema and dump.

‚úÖ If login is successful, the database connection is verified.

- Screenshot:

![alt text](<images/09.Login to the Application.png>)

### üì¶ Step 3: Validate RabbitMQ Integration

Click the **"RabbitMQ"** button (available only to the `admin_vp` user).

- If the message _"Queues and connection established successfully"_ appears, RabbitMQ is working correctly.
- If you see an error or no response, troubleshoot the RabbitMQ setup.

- Screenshot:

![alt text](<images/10. Validate RabbitMQ.png>)

---

### üíæ Step 4: Validate Memcached

Click the **"All Users"** button:

- This triggers a database call and lists all users.
- Select any user (e.g., `Aron`).
- First time: Data is fetched from the database and stored in Memcached.
- Second time: Data is fetched quickly from cache (no DB hit).

üí° This demonstrates how the cache improves response time for repeated data access.

- Screenshots:

![alt text](<images/11.1 Validate Memcached.png>)

![alt text](<images/11.2 Validate Memcached.png>)

---

### üßπ Step 5: (Optional) Destroy the Setup

After validation, you can clean up the environment:

```bash
vagrant destroy --force
```
